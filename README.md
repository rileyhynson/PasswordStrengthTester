# PasswordStrengthTester

# About the project
The chosen case study for the project is the Password Strength Tester. 
The Password Strength Tester will help show users how secure their password is by analysing the characters used, for example, symbols and numbers as well as the character length of the password. 
It also compares the password to a list of commonly used passwords and compromised passwords to inform the user of how secure their passwords are based on a ‘weak’ - ‘moderate’ - ‘strong’ or ‘very strong’ result. 
This will tell users how they can improve their password to reach the very strong result and if the password they are currently using could easily be compromised. 
The overall objective of the project is to increase the users cyber security awareness and basics by improving how secure their passwords are and how secure their accounts are. 

# User Guide - How to Use the Program

# Problem Analysis
The issue that is presented in the case study is that passwords could be guessable, meaning that the user’s accounts could be compromised. 
To help with preventing this issue, the user could use this program to help them improve their passwords and in turn help them to improve the security of their accounts and make them less vulnerable to an attack from a malicious user. 

# Requirements
The automation solution must be able to provide the user on how secure their accounts by telling them how secure and safe the password is that you are using by providing a result as mentioned above.
